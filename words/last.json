        "LAST is an acronym for Latino American Standard Time. There are essentially three guiding principles behind LAST.1.) To be “on time” means one can show up at any point up to 1 hour after the agreed upon time.\n2.) If one arrives between 1 hour up to 2 hours after, it’s “cutting it close”.3.) Lastly, if one arrives anytime after 2 hours they are officially “late”, and any time before the agreed upon time qualifies them as a “lunatic” (or any other variant of this word).e.g.) If the agreed upon time is 12:00 pm: one arrives “on time” between 12:00 pm and 1:00 pm, “cutting it close” would be between 1:00 pm and 2:00 pm, arriving any time after 2:00 pm is “late”, and arriving any time before 12:00 pm makes one a “lunatic”.",
