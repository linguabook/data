        "A drug stereotypically popular in England. Comes from India or China. Sold in brightly coloured boxes advertising its healthy properties. Highly addictive. Massive advertising campaigns on TV and billboards. \nResponsible for the Britiah Empire, but superceded by coffee in the American Empire, due to coffee's more intense hit. Universally drunk by English people. \nThe best way to drink it is in a mug, with milk and two sugars. Some people only have one, but that's just being in denial. Two sugars or none, that's my motto. Or even worse, one and a half. Come on, who are you fooling? Some people get really kinky and drink it BLACK. NO milk, NO sugar, NO hope. No way. Simply Wrong. \n\nI would recommend undertaking tea addiction. Luckily it is available at every corner store, at very reasonable prices. You may have seen adverts on TV, e.g. \"Yorkshire Tea.. the way tea USED to be.\" Yeah, back in the days before the evil American Empire. When it was the British Empire instead.Tea is one of the best things ever, I love it. I'm drinking it now."
