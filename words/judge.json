Just because a person is clumsy doesn't mean they have a low iq, just because a person is a stripper doesn't mean they don't have a heart of gold.. But prejudice isn't a good thing and it hurts people feeling and someone will always prejudge you the same way. If a person fucks your girlfriend would you still not judge and forgive him.
