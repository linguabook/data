What's so wrong about that...they thought it made a lot of sense.  And what's wrong with the original spelling...obviously that's the way the Brits liked it!\n\nI can't believe some of the postings on here...with the Brits calling us \"lazy\" and \"stupid\" for changing the spelling of a word, and with us calling them ridiculous because their version has an \"extra letter\"...for Pete's sake, it's a fucking WORD.\n\nLanguage evolves over time, so deal with it and stop bitching about insignificant things, like everyday language.  There's much more important stuff going on out there...",
