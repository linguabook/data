        "The book is lavishly illustrated with photographs of items from the exhibit (always in full color) and other supporting material (in black and white).",
        "The book makes good use of black and white photographs, has a useful appendix on methodology and an excellent bibliography.",

        "A Book is like .. a non-volatile, stable database that does not lose data no matter how many times you drop it, spill your beer on it, or close it incorrectly. Books are more stable even than Optical Media. Storage is only limited by the amount of space and volume that the owner can physically carry. Some storage units seem to last for years, and whilst the background colour or 'fill' of the pages may degrade to a kind of #F5F5DC beige, the actual data is still readily retrievable.Books were used for storage before computers. The only reason computers were invented was due to the poor fire retardant properties of the base materials used in the manufacture of books (especially those books used to upset the tribal elders of religious groups) and because books were easy to steal data from. Books have also been used to store ideas for Movies That No-one Has Made Yet.",

        "Books are amazing things that were forgotten after the internet came along. Some still enjoy reading, others groan whenever someone tells them to read. They would rather wait for the movie to come out. Books ARE movies. They transport you to amazing worlds, they let your imagination run free. Not all books are interesting,but the ones that are...Amazing.",

        "a book is a place to let your mind run free from reality, you are given words that you can completely make your own with just the way you think. a book is one of gods greatest gifts. and with new technolegy the number of books is going down and with that so is the number of people with imagination. to many they are just words assembled on pages but to others they are a work of art creating their own world.",
