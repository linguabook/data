        "Will is a guy who cares a lot about other people. He feels like people don’t have any reason to care about him, but so many people love him unconditionally (romantically and not). He is a funny, popular, kind of weird guy. He is smarter than he thinks he is and a hard worker. He can make friends wherever he goes once he gets out of his shell. He is a guy that can always make you laugh. He will make fun of you in an “older brother” way, but you do the same to him. He can be a bit dramatic but you stick with him because you know it’s worth it. If you meet a Will, get to know him. He is complex and amazing.",
        "Marginalized Orientations, Gender identities, And Intersex. it’s meant to be an all inclusive umbrella term for asexuals, homosexuals, multisexuals, trans people, and intersex people. Alternative to LGBTQIAP+\nAlternative to MOGII, easier to pronounce.",
        "Will is a guy that might be the sweetest human being to walk the earth. He's been through so much more than anyone can ever imagine and you can talk to him about any problem. He's an amazing lover, super hot, and a great person to cuddle with. When he walks by the lady's surround him saying his name, and boys go gay for him. Total sex god",
        "The cure to all the world's unhappiness, sorrow, guilt, greed, etc. Will is the cure to every possible malady and sadness. He is the most beautiful man to ever walk the earth. He can make you laugh, cry, and just kiss him until your lips hurt. He is the greatest thing to ever happen to anyone in the world, especially me. He is an actor, a singer, and the best friend and boyfriend a girl could have. Whenever you are around Will you can't think any thought other than a thought about him. When you look in his eyes your body goes numb and you can only focus on breathing. The way he confounds you with his intelligence can make you sit there completely confused. He is, just...so amazing. There is no way you can truly say how much you will love him.",
        "An all around complete stud. The only human being in the world able to defeat Chuck Norris in a fist to fist fight. The girls want him, and the guys want to be him.",
        "A nice guy usually has a lot of inside jokes with people and is a fun dude to chill with. He may have his ups and downs but who doesn't at least that's what he says. If u know a will then every time you hang with him you will never be bored he will make you laugh and u will leave happy.Every Will may be different, but all the ones I know are exactly how I just explained. If you know a will that is like the one I explained u are one lucky girl/guy cause they are good friends.",
        "Will, also known as A.J has DNA straight from God. He has Brilliance way beyond his years and knows practically everything there is to know on earth and in all other dimensions that are and ever were. He can make anything and fix everything. Will is a timeless soul like a vampire or something immortal. When Will goes out in public men stare in jealousy or run to his assistance. Women stare, breathlessly, wet and wishing. He is so tall and built like a God. Naturally fit and muscular with perfect brown hair. When Will has his eyes on a girl, all he has to do is look at her with that irresistible, sexy smile and his sparkling, green glittering eyes that without fail will pull any girl to her knees begging to be enslaved. When you talk to Will it’s like you are in a dream a different dimension and the world as you know it is no longer. Time stops. Like the matrix. Will controls time and can keep you in his world as long as he wants you there and he will get you addicted to the feeling he gives you so much that you’ll end up leaving everything you’ve ever known just to stay in his force field, high on his existence. With Will time flies by and you won’t even know it because you’re just in awe of his magic. Will invented magic. He himself is a phenomenon! If you meet a Will you should study his every move and observe his way because he is the way, the truth and the light. And where there is a Will there is a way. He is the Will to survive. Will is Life."
