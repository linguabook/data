They take away freedoms on a yearly and sometimes monthly basis when they could be doing things such as solving problems such as murders, kidnappings, and homelessness.Ironically, humans are not the only ones with governments, animals also have governments as well and the animals run their governments a lot more efficiently than any human can run theirs. For example, ants make sure that every member of their colony is fed and this includes their larvae or babies. Wasps do the same and bees also. This means that despite humans claiming that they're the smartest animals around, they are so idiotic that they are unable to run a system correctly.",
