They are most commonly used to gain access to locked doors and windows.  The halligan bar has three different prying tips on it.  They are a spike, a wedge, and a two-pronged fork or claw.  By inserting one of these tips into a door or window frame and driving it with the flat-head ax, the trained firefighter can make quick access through most common types of doors.  By driving the spike into the floor, the halligan bar becomes a good anchor point to attach a rope during emergency rescue procedures.  The flat-head ax is also useful for cutting through windows and doors that may be boarded up.  The Irons are carried with a special \"marriage\" strap, the blade of the ax inserted into the slot of the claw on one end, and the handle of the ax resting between the spike and the wedge on the other."
