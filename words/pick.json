        "A triangular or tear dropped shaped piece of plastic use to pluck the stings of a guitar. At first glance they appear inanimate ordinary plastic; however guitar picks are actually made from a very rare from of sentient plastic that has a tendency to roam around when left unattended. Their adventures can last up to two full weeks, and while most picks usually return to their place of origin, a poor sense of direction cause many to become lost, and some even intentionally run away. Picks also have a unique telepathic ability and can sense peoples joy, the more one enjoys using a particular pick, the more likely it is to abandon its owner.",
