        "Near is an orphan who grew up at the Wammy's House orphanage. During his entire time at the orphanage he was competing with Mello to become L's successor. He was known to be very antisocial, as in the manga a fellow student (Linda) asked him to play outside and he declined.With Near's introverted-ness probably came loneliness, though Near seems to have next to no emotion. To deal, he plays with many childish toys, such as; toy robots, action figures and finger puppets. he also enjoys making elaborate card and dice towers. In the one-shot (Ch. 109) set three years after the Kira case, Near is seen to be surrounded by a enormous tarrot card tower that reaches the ceiling and spreads around the room.Speaking of which, in the one-shot Near is still seen playing with his finger puppets. Now, of course, he only has himself, L, and... Mello? Though Mello has no use being there, Near still keeps Mello's creepy little finger puppet. Is it so he can make his puppet and Mello's make out? No one can be certain. However, Near does show a deal of respect towards Mello and many suspect he had a crush on him. Poor guy.Near is hated by many, but I personally think that if you would only read the one-shot he would grow on you. Or you would just come to your senses and realize how adorable he is.Near lovers, unite!",
