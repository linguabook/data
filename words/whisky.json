        "Whisky or Scotch, or Uisge Beatha in Gaelic, is a type of distilled beverage from fermented grain mash. Different grains are used for different varieties, including barley, rye, corn cum wheat. Whisky’s aged in wooden casks, made generally of white oak. The distillate must age for at least three years and one day in Scotland to be called Scotch whisky, although most single malts are offered at a minimum of eight years of age. Scotch whisky is divided into five distinct categories: single malt, blended malt , blended Scotch whisky, blended grain Scotch whisky, and single grain Scotch whisky. Plain caramel colouring may be added. That is the greatest liquor I have ever drunk so far! I cannot imagine what the world would be without whisky.",
        "Marginalized Orientations, Gender identities, And Intersex. it’s meant to be an all inclusive umbrella term for asexuals, homosexuals, multisexuals, trans people, and intersex people. Alternative to LGBTQIAP+\nAlternative to MOGII, easier to pronounce.",
        "What men drink.",
        "Why Do the Scots spell it without the ''E'', \nBecause We Invented it thats why! ,originally called uisge beatha ''water of life'', in the Gaelic Tongue.",
        "The Most Marvelous Drink in the world and 'nae mistake'has had to fight off many imposters over the years ie:\n                                                                        Whiskey(Bourbon),canadian whisky,Irish whiskey,japanese whisky, and even welsh whisky!many decent attempts but none have matched the original ,especially the Single Malts of which there are many, enjoyed by true connoiseurs.Each Whisky has its own distinct character reflecting the 'glen' or region it was born. The Term 'Whisky' is an anglisced corruption of the Gaelic word 'uisge' meaning water, or to give it its correct term 'Uisge beatha', 'The water of life!',Blended Whiskies are cheaper than Malts and contain a mix of both grain and malt whiskies. Often Referred to as Scotch by non Scots or ocasionaly by Scots Abroad to be sure they are not served an 'imposter'",
        "1. Liquor distilled from a fermented mash of grain, as barley, corn, or rye. From the Gaelic Uisge Beatha, \"water of life.\"\n2.A drink of whisky.\nAlso \"whiskey\"",
        "A drink created in Ireland, not Scotland, which seems to be a popular belief. Scotland only got it's hand on the whisky created by the Irish nation about 100 years after it started making it. It also means 'the water of life' in the Irish language."
