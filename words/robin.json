Maybe God Himself created her just to look fantastic and be awesome. I have no idea, but she's definitely doing it anyway. Robins can be mistaken for being inappropriate-in a sense. But really they're just outgoing and very independent, and not to forget, beautiful. Robins have a way of just making you do things, and making you believe whatever she wants you to! It's really cool, you should meet one."
