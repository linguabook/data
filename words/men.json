Some of us are actually not sexist testosterone filled nut jobs.\nIf you ever get married, try and avoid those types.",

A lot are very homophobic because they can't let anyone know they are gay or bi.\nSo girls ask your man if he would have sex with another man, and if he shows his disgust for more than a hour... hes gay.",
        "1. Purely logical and emotionally stable, they will insult each other and gossip during their daily man talk, as well as throw epic manly hissy-fits when they FAIL. (Which is pretty much all the time.)\nThey secretly wish they had their own pair of boobies.",
        "The reason for many of girl's problems. Mostly because they think they want anything more than to enter their magical vaginia.",
        "Men can be the most wonderful thing ever for a woman to meet , or they can be selfish pigs who want women to do everything for their lazy asses. All men are different , so you would have to get to know a man before you judge him , but women can be just as bad by judging him to soon and not loving a man , just wanting to suck him dry of his money. Some woman will respect a man and not care about the money , just how much they love their man. In return a REAL man should give respect back and love her , help her with the house work , and honestly think they are equals. Men should not have to respect women who are bitches to them and steal their money and so on , so if any man out their is being treated badly by a woman and getting no respect from their equal , and you ARE respecting her , then dump the bitch and go find yourself a REAL woman , and leave sterotypical woman behind.\n\nI know for a fact men and women are exactly the same , even though they look different , deep-down their all equals , because some women are either nice or mean and thats the same for men.\n\n if your a man and you think your better than all woman , just because your a man ... THEN FUCK YOU! AND IM TALKING TO THE WOMEN AS WELL IN THIS KIND OF MATTER!\n\nand unfortunately , woman have to suffer with periods and have mood swings they cant control sometimes , and REAL men will know she cant help it , will not judge and try to not get in the way of the mean machine of the month! \nIt affects men to , so sorry for the men who have to grin and bear it every once a month , but im sure it will help if you think about how the women is feeling just as bad as you ( pain-wise ).\n\nWithout men , the human race could survive.\n\nWithout women , the human race could not survive. \n                                           both men and women are responsible for being parents and should not leave the baby alone with the other parent , they should work together as a team. Sadly a lot of men still try to be better than woman and don't realize the equality. The olden days , when men ruled , women were useless because no-one taught them to do anything except raise kids and now look at today , how society has become better! I hope im alive to see men and women treated the same and the mojority of them dont act like complete pricks. With the women today , and how they are comparing to many years ago , i beleive that day will come some day.\n\nthe point of this is really...\n\nMen ... can't live with them , can't live without them.\n\nWoman ... can't live with them , can't live without them.\n\nI hope this writing makes you realise the true solution , even though the solution to the problem with men and women will probably solved on its on , in time...\n\nThank You For Reading :D :)",
