        "The state I am in now. For the 5 people who have never gotten high, I will try to explain it. at first, before you are really high, you become really giddy and will laugh at the slightest thing. you also may remember random things and pointlessly share them. When you are high, it feels very much like your dreaming. when you are sober, it may be hard to remember wut happened when you were high, much like how its hard to remember a dream after you wake up. when you are high, your vision gets messed up. some people compare it to watching your vision in a movie theater. for example, if you turned on your tv while high, it may seem like you are sitting in a movie theater watching a movie of yourself turning on a tv in the first person. also, you see things in a different perspective. if you are high enough, your own house can seem completely different! music is also heard in a different perspective. it can seem like the music surrounds you. I like to describe it as being \"in the music\". Different music can have different effects on you. old school rock can make you trip out or go crazy. rap can make you freestyle better than you ever thought possible. techno can actually sound cool. your balance and coordination are afffected when you are high. you frequently move around and almost fall if you're high enough. simple tasks (like typing this) can be a lot harder when you're high. also watching things can be different, particulary animated things. I strongly recomend watchin the animatrix while high to find out what im talkin about. i tried my best to explain being high, but really the only way to understand it is to get high yourself. so, for you five who have never gotten high, go get lots of weed and smoke it now! Note: once you've been smoking weed for a while, it can be very hard to achieve the state i described.",
        "You know your *high* when you exhibit the following characteristics:\n\n1. you laugh uncontrollably because you realize how high you are and how high everyone else is and how everything else you wouldn't give a second thought about when your sober is now compltely ridicoulous.\n2. your vision gets really sensitive and your eyes may feel like they're messed up. don't worry, thats just pressure being relieve from them caused by an excess of blood flow to the cornea and conjuctiva.\n3. you find yourself thinking about something deeply introspective (metacognition) and then completely forget what you were thinking about, then spend all your mental energy on trying to remember what you were thinking about, only for you to forget that you were trying to remember something you forgot about and just start to think about something completley different.\n4. your sexual desire will increase, and you will talk to anything that you want to engages in sexual intercourse with, with complete disregard for what your actually saying. if you do engage in a sexual act you will find that it will be incredible and every sensation you feel will be better by an exponential margin. \n5. music sounds amazing. you will hear every single instrument used, without really listening to it. certain genres of music and certain musicians will make your high feel elevated. music will put your mind into a pensive and contemplative state and you can spend hours engaged in this activity.\n6. your apetite will increase and you will find that every piece of food you consume tastes ridiculously amazing. you will not realize how much food you consume until someone tells you that you ate the entire bag of cheetohs, at which point you will look for a bag of doritos or fun-yuns\n7. you will aprecciate everything around you and a state of absolute euphoria will encompass your psychological activity. Stress and worry will be reduced by a large amount.\n8. confusion sets in and you will find yourself baffled at very elementary problems. (Note** never do you homework or attempt to take a test under the influence of marijuana)\n\n      \nheres a tip: get your group of your best friends and some weed over to your back yard. turn on some pink floyd or bone thugs-n-harmony. roll a blunt, (cigar sized marijuana cigarette) pass it around, relax and enjoy the good time your spending with your friends.",
        "The feeling you get after smoking sweet, sweet Mary Jane. Vaporizers, joints, blunts, bowls, bongs -- it don't matter, 'cause we're high! It's hard to explain if you've never tried weed before, but here it is:\n\n1. Voice \nBefore it really sinks in, everything's just really funny; you're high, they're high, and somehow, that's really funny. Words that never seemed humorous are suddenly the shit and words that never made sense together now make perfect sense. Forgetting things is frequent; you'll be mid-sentence, forget the sentence, struggle to remember, forget that you were trying to remember something, then make a whole new sentence.\nSome people talk louder without realizing it when they're high; others get quieter.\n\n2. Hearing\nMusic sounds amazing; like it's all around you, coming at you from all directions. Almost like a movie theater. You're so out of it you even think YOU sound good singing.\n\n3. Vision\nThings may look almost holographic, like they're popping out at you. That's probably because your eyes are mad big. People seem to look a lot hotter than before, and you may also feel like people are watching you.. Trust me, they are.\n\n4. Taste\nIf you're high at all, you'll be hungry. Try not to go too insane -- you'll regret it when you're sober. One thing I noticed is that everything tastes 1000000x better; stronger, I guess.\n\n5. Touch\nYou're incredibly self-aware; you have this warm feeling of security all around you. Cold things may not feel cold or hot things may not feel hot.\n\n6. Behavior\nPeople who are normally not affectionate are suddenly all over each other. Stoner hugs are commonplace. You might have deep thoughts or you might think total nonsense. You're often incredibly gullible, which makes it ridiculously easy to trip someone out. Some people have mood swings when they're high; they'll get paranoid or throw a hissy fit over random shit.\n\n7. Balance/Coordination\nThere really isn't any. Holding onto other people isn't just for the affection but to stay off your ass. The ground often feels tilted to the right or left, or the world may seem to spin around you.\n\n8. Memory\nNone of that, either. You'll often leave stuff places and forget where you put it, or think you left something somewhere when it's actually in your hand. It may be hard to remember what you did when you were high once you've sobered up.\n\n9. General Feeling\nA feeling of content bliss. Time passes really slowly and that's just the way you like it. Nothing can possibly go wrong. You really don't give a damn what's going on around you; the feeling's all encompassing. Zombie invasion? Okay, then. Terrorist bomb? That's great. Apocalypse? Not today, 'cause God loves you tokers!\n\nSome other terms are; baked, toked, stoned",
        "the most amazing feeling in the world. the first couple times you smoke, you almost feel like you're in a dream, watching the world go on around you. things also seem to be going in slow motion. when you're high, every little thing will seem funny, and you'll laugh till your stomach hurts. even at things that aren't meant to be funny, like someone saying their dog got run over by a tractor. you're eyes get real red and squinty, so make sure you keep a bottle of rhotos or visine on you. you also have th appetite of a wild animal, and you'll eat everything in sight. those munchies never fail. when you're high, you come up with ideas that seem amazing at the time, but then you don't remember them when you're not high. i'm really high right now. all in all, weed is godly.",
        "a feeling of euphoria. It's hard to explain, but basically they best feeling you will ever have. You feel nothing, but goodness. You're not cold or hot or uncomfortable in any way, it is just pure happiness, you feel no pain just a rush. It takes a lot longer to do something and you move really slow but it feels as if things are happening at a faster rate. You rap hella well and laugh hysterically at everything, it seems almost as if you're not really breathing. Something you say seems so thoughtful and deep but really its just meaningless stoner talk. Everything is beautiful and smiling at you. feel like a straw, as if water or some substance is rushing through your entire body and your spinning but it doesn't make you sick you feel like you're twitching but in reality you're not. People laugh at you, however you don't care because you're not actually there. Spend all morning rolling, so you can smoke later. ledge. being in a hella sketch place and just lighting up, not caring about anything, peer pressuring people into it, talking about everything and anything. your smoking instruments are you're babies.you make new friends. you never want to stop, you feel as weed is all you need. you wake up the next day still blazed out of your mind but feel the need to wake and back, and finally, every Kottonmouth Kings, Slightly Stoopid and Expendables song narrates you're fucking lifeeeeeeeee."
