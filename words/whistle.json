Although it is never distinguished or addressed directly, it becomes apparent that the term 'whistle' really refers to ONLY a pistol, a semi-matic handgun.David Simon's bestseller book and basically the father/catalyst of The Wire is 'Homicide'. Again the term 'whistle' is NOT explicitly defined) (Wether its only a pistol, or maybe a type of Mac/Tec or a shotgun) However the book does make it clear that 'whistle' is a term used in Baltimore. This isn't explained out right, but through stories, recorded conversations with citizens and the times when slang was recorded throughout the book, it becomes abundantly clear that the use of the term is authentic, meaning 'whistle' is actively used there.",
