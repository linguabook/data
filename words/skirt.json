Skirts and dresses are ususally worn for formal occasions today.\n\nTight skirts can be uncomfortable or difficult to move in, and wide skirts can lead to embarrassing situations if it's windy day and especially if the fabric is too lightweight. \n\nMini-skirts can be troublesome, since they might expose the underwear and not provide proper coverage for the buttocks and groin.\n\nStill, skirts do provide more freedom from the often uncomfortable confinements of trousers and provide modesty if a woman must relieve herself outdoors.\n\nWomen can also wear leggings underneath skirts for warmth and/or modesty, should they feel the need.",
