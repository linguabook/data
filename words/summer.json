She is spontaneous, seductively beautiful in the most natural way.The moment that you let her go, she will wish that you didn't because she will be the only woman in your life that will ever make sense of it all. She is perfectly imperfect. Stubborn, beautiful, intellectually attuned, and passionate about changing the way that we see things.She is a man's last love because any woman after that will never compare.

She always catches a guys attention. If you have a summer in your life never let her go. Summer is a mans lady and she is the type of girl that every guy wants. She is loyal and sometimes she can be a bit crazy. Summer can get wild and she always loves a good party. And don't mess with her because if you hurt her feelings she will get mad and she can be violent and sassy. But summer is also happy, nice and kind just like the season.
