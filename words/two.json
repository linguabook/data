You have a brain for logic, but then you have the heart to counter balance with emotions. \n\n-Not only used for balancing, but combined for the ultimate pair. In order to start a family, you need 2. Every hero needs a sidekick. you have not 1 but 2 eyes for ultimate depth perception. 2 arms, 2 legs, 2 ears, 2 lungs, 2 testicals.\n\n-most powerful number in math. 2 is the number most divisible into other numbers (not counting 1 since one is itself and more or less is the building block of all numbers). 2 is what we build off of. It's so simple, yet so strong. Subconsciously you know this to be true since when refering to something simple or basic, we say \"put 2 and 2 together.\" Why dont we say \"put 1 and 1 together?\" We don't see 1 as a credible number, holding 2 in higher regards.\n\n-2 is the only number that can't make a shape(number of sides). 1 is a circle. 3 is a triangle. But what is 2? Think about it...\n\n-There are only 2 things to do with your life, live or die.\n\n-For every action, there is a re-action. one things leads to one other thing. that equals 2. we live our lives between 2's. we go to work to get money to live. we work out to get buff. we eat to satiate our hunger. \n\n-Everything has an opposite, or equal other, that makes them a pair of 2. There is only good or evil. There is only right or wrong.\n\n2 packs quite a punch, don't you think?",

It just flows from there."
