By taking off your had, or doing a various of other actions with it, is a sign that you are, or will get very amazed.\n\nWhich guys are in the possession of such a had, is currently unknown, but the hads aren't existing in big numbers. Not many people has gotten their hand on one. Rumor has it that even the King of Britain has one.\n\n\"Had\" is becoming a known term in the community called xtreme-jumps.eu(XJ)"
