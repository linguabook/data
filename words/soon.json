Whenever Louis is asked about when his album, merch, tour, a single is coming out he says SOON. Fans are a mix between losing all hope that soon is within the next decade and telling everyone else to be patient. Louis likes to watch this all unfold. He knows very well what he is doing. Louis owns the word soon. If anyone else uses the word soon not relating to Louis, they will be seen in the court of law or in a Twitter battle with Louie/Directioners that will force you to dig your own grave. Don't mess with Directioners/Louies, they learned their sarcasm from Louis Tomlinson himself. So the question remains: When is Louis releasing LT1? SOON.",
