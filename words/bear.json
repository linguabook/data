        "The most common definition of a \"bear\" is a man who is hairy, has facial hair, and a cuddly body. However, the word \"Bear\" means many things to different people, even within the bear movement. Many men who do not have one or all of these characteristics define themselves as bears, making the term a very loose one. Suffice it to say, \"bear\" is often defined as more of an attitude than anything else - a sense of comfort with our natural masculinity and bodies that is not slavish to the vogues of male attractiveness that is so common in gay circles and the culture at large.",
        "A fuzzy and cute woodland creature. Very huggable, but if hugging is attempted it is likely that the bear will maul and/or kill the hugger.",
