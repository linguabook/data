        "a way stan twitter uses to say \"i-\" or \"im-\"used when youre speechless or shocked at something.",
        "Marginalized Orientations, Gender identities, And Intersex. it’s meant to be an all inclusive umbrella term for asexuals, homosexuals, multisexuals, trans people, and intersex people. Alternative to LGBTQIAP+\nAlternative to MOGII, easier to pronounce.",
        "eyes (n.) - Traditionally defined as a feature on a living creature’s body that allows it to see, this simple area of the body is considered by some to be the most beautiful and mystifying physical feature of another person (especially the eyes of a woman).  Unlike the breasts, legs, or gluteus maximus (which are often associated with physical beauty in women) the eyes hold value outside of the realm of sexuality.  (Some would even argue that, for this reason alone, the admiration of a woman's eyes is more respectable and pure than being physically attracted toward some element of her sex.) Some men find the most dazzling feature of a woman to be her eyes, leaving everything else as all but completely irrelevant.  Looking into a woman’s eyes, one can sometimes peer into her soul.",
        "why look this up, if you dont have them you cant read this and probably have already had it explained to you that a certain item in/on your body is either missing or not working...good day to you",
        "The window to the soul.",
        "What noobs use to emphasize the word \"I\". Since I is already capitalized in proper syntax, it will have little effect on emphasis.... But real people just say *i*.",
        "Eyes are not only “the key to the soul” as alot of people say. The eyes tell all mainly what I like is you can see the laughter and happiness in the eyes you can see all emotions they are the only part of your body that truly show your emotions and you can never hide them in your eyes."
