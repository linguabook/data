        "Contrary to popular belief, bees aren’t just merciless bugs that sting just because they can. They *dont want* to sting you, because if they do they will die immediately. They are actually more scared of you than you are of them. If you threaten them, they have no choice but to use their self defense. So if a bee lands on you or is just getting on your nerves, stay completely calm and still. If you do get stung, again don’t panic. *Do not* pinch the stinger and pull it out. This will inject the poison, which is what makes a sting hurt so bad. Instead, scrape out the stinger with your fingernail.Bees are actually vital to the envirement. While making honey, they pollinate crops. Without them, our whole food system would fall apart, bringing with it the industry and income of millions of crops.Bees are hardworking insects that produce honey. If you own a beehive, you can harvest beeswax, honey, and even propolis-but only after your bees get through the winter. With this, you can make jars of honey, candles, and other things even including chapstick.",
