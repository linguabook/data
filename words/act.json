        "ACT is an acronym standing for Action Counters Terror. It is believed that it originated either with the military or the emergency services, where personnel are trained to overcome fear and inertia by taking action until this becomes an automatic response. ACT demonstrates that people are capable of really remarkable deeds and that obstacles and difficulties can be beaten when they are confronted. ACT shows that fears and self-doubt can be reduced or eliminated and that forward-looking action can overcome habit and inertia to produce something new and start the process of change.",
        "Marginalized Orientations, Gender identities, And Intersex. it’s meant to be an all inclusive umbrella term for asexuals, homosexuals, multisexuals, trans people, and intersex people. Alternative to LGBTQIAP+\nAlternative to MOGII, easier to pronounce.",
        "Short for Actavis, a brand name prescription cough syrup containing codeine and promethazine; See lean",
        "An acronym standing for Action Conquers Terror. It is unclear whether this was originally a military acronym, where personnel are trained to overcome fear by action until this becomes automatic. It does, however, highlight that people are capable of far more than they realise, and that fears can be beaten when they are confronted. Action show fears and self-doubt as merely a question of attitude; forward-looking action overcomes habit and inertia to produce something new and is the simplest way to start the process of change.",
        "(1) (also ACT Assessment) A standardized test, administered mostly in the midwestern United States by the ACT organization.  ACT stood for American College Testing until 1996 when, in a similar manner to the SAT, it shortened its name to ACT to \"better reflect the broad range of services\" they offer to high school students.\n\n(2) An abbreviation for Australian Capital Territory, which contains Canberra, Australia's capital (NOT Sydney).",

        "An SAT-style test that's so baller easy that someone like me who says \"baller\" can manage to get a 31."
