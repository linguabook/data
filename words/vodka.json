It was originally made in Russia from potatoes, but today's vodka, which is almost odorless and tasteless, is usually made from grain, primarily barley and wheat, and occationally from rye.\n\nVodka is integral to many cocktails such as the Screwdriver, Bloody Mary and Vodka Martini. If served straight, it should always be icy-cold.\n\nFlavored vodkas have become popular in the United States and may be flavored with anything from fruits to hot peppers. Some flavored vodkas are even sweetened slightly.",
        "As a Russian who is experienced in the art of vodka consumption i feel obligated to provide the following information about vodka drinking.\nA) Vodka should never ever under any circumstances be bought in a plastic bottle\nB) Vodka should never be served ice-cold or even moderately could when straight. BUT!!!!! the shoot glass should be ice cold.\nC) Just because you have a carton of Tropicana and a bottle of Smirnoff doesn't mean you can make a screwdriver. Screwdrivers never have any plump in them\nD) When drinking vodka never sip it, or drink it slowly! This way of drinking vodka leads to loss of taste buds and a reeking smell.\nE) Before taking a shot of vodka cheers must be said, then let out all the air you have in your lungs, drink and inhale at the same time.\nF) NEVER EVER CHASE VODKA WTH BEAR\nG) A good tactic for not getting sick while drinking vodka, is to supplement it with soda and some snacks.\nH) Drinking vodka together with bear and champagne leads to short term memory loss.\n\nfacts\nVodka a 40% alcoholic drink. In theory it can be made out of anything, even wood or marijuana. The solution to this magnificent drink is extremely simple: a 2/5 ratio of alcohol and water. Non-mass produced vodka, which is available in most of Europe and Russia, is an expensive high quality drink, which went through as many as 8 stages of filtration and sold for more that 100$ a bottle.\nRarely it is mixed in to cocktails, such as vodka martini and the screw driver.\nIn the United States only commercial, mass produced vodka is available and has a number of flaws. A) it is not made in Russia, even if it is called Smirnoff of Stolichnaya, but New Jersey or in the best case scenario Sweden.\nBest brand of Vodka are: VEDA and BELUGA BLACK, these two brands made Stoli and Absolute look like absolute shit!\nPlease drink responsibly and enjoy."
