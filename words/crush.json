You just want to scream to him or her: I REALLy like you and hope you feel the same way. Or you really want to know if he or she has the same feelings for you, or if they like someone else. It would help you feel so much better. Sometimes, even though I find it weird, I still cry about all of the emotional problems I'm having. I also obsess over my crush with my friend. We obssess over our crushes together. If you want, you could also write that special person a note and then sign your name. Crushes are wonderful, but very painful, thus the word: crush."
