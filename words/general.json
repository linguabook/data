China use splash weapons and huge numbers to overwhelm their opponents. the GLA are a Middle Eastern alliance that use stealth, suprise, terrorist tactics and require little resources for construction/military. Each faction also has unique Superweapons. USA has a particle cannon structure firing a beam of energy that the player can train anywhere on the map resulting in instant unit kill and heavy damage to buildings.
